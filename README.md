# ReMacro

# TestMacros
Contains a Macro to create the "subject" of a unit test. The Macro works on the assumption that the "subject" is simply the filename, minus the extension and the word "test(s)" at the end.

# Templates
Contains two File Templates I have found useful, they make use (and work under the assumption) of [Moq.AutoMock](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Moq.AutoMock/) and [AutoFixture](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoFixture). However feel free to modify the templates to your needs and any frameworks you may be using!
